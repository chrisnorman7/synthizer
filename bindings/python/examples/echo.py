"""Demonstrates how to configure echo in a  relatively real-world scenario akin to what a reverb would do for early reflections.

By setting taps up in various configurations, it's possible to get a number of different effects.

Usage is echo.py myfile.
For best results, use a music file or something that's long enough to play as long as the sleeps at the end of this file."""
