# Installation

We support Python 3.8 and later.  To install the Python bindings:

```bash
pip install synthizer
```

Note the following platform specific information:

On Windows, wheels for both 32-bit and 64-bit Python are uploaded to Pypi and no
build step is required.


On Linux, and mac, the Python bindings build themselves from source and will
require network access in order to download the Synthizer source code and other
build tools.  Additionally, Linux requires the latest version of gcc and g++,
and Mac requires xcode.  CI currently tests against the latest version of oSX
supported by GitHub Actions, Ubuntu 18, and Ubuntu 20.
