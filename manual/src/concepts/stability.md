# Stability and Versioning

Synthizer uses pre-1.0 semantic versioning.  This means:

- Major is always 0.
- Minor is incremented for incompatible API changes.
- Patch is incremented for new features and/or bug fixes.

Synthizer is intended to be production ready software, but has not seen wide
usage.  It's somewhere between beta and 1.0: not as many features as you might
want, but also not crashing at the drop of a hat. If you find bugs, please
report them [against the official
repository](https://github.com/synthizer/synthizer).

API breakage is still expected.  This manual attempts to document where API
breakage may occur.  These are referred to as provisional features.
